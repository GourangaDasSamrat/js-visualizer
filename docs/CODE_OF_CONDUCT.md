## Enforcement Guidelines

The maintainer will follow these guidelines when determining consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1 — Correction

**Community impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2 — Warning

**Community impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved — including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct — for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3 — Temporary Ban

**Community impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved — including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct — is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4 — Permanent Ban

**Community impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
